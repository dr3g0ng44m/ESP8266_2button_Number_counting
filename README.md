# ESP8266_2button_Number_counting
I will use two button to increase/decrase value and print to Serial.
My circut is showed in PNG file, Button1 is connect to pin GPIO4(D2) as IncreaseInputButton, Button2 is connect to pin GPIO14(D5) as DecreaseInputButton.
I actualize this purpose by using Finite State Machine with 8 states describe in FSM.PNG
