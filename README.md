# ESP8266_2button_Number_counting
I will use two button to increase/decrase value and print to Serial.\
My circut is showed in NodeMCU.PNG file:\
-Button1 is connect to pin GPIO4(D2) as IncreaseInputButton,\
-Button2 is connect to pin GPIO14(D5) as DecreaseInputButton.\
I actualize this purpose by using Finite State Machine with 8 states describe in FSM.PNG
